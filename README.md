# Introduction

In this project you will find a small example with Spring Boot in which you will be able to perform CRUD oepraciones for users, as well as activate and deactivate them. All this in a very isolated way to a graphical interface, the way it will be done through endpoints that rest requests, which can be consumed from Postman or any other client that has the capacity to consume them.
